No makefile, nothing to compile.  Just some shell and python scripts.


fetch-certs
	Fetches certs from Apple, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and
	Akamai perissive-set and global-server contents.
	It actually uses a public GitHub repo to get the external
	certs.  Each trust store has its own directory.

make-page
	Generates an HTML page, called index.html, that contains
	the comparisons.  That page includes jquery.min.js and
	jquery.tablesorter.min.js to do the table/column cleverness.
	Put all three files in the same directory and point your
	browser there.

akamai-missing
	A list of what akamai permissive-set is missing that the
	all the others (apple, google, microsoft, mozilla) have.
	It outputs a list of the SHA256 digests, which isn't friendly,
	but you can do things like
	    foreach F $(./akamai-missing) ; do
		cat certs.apple/$F
	    done
	Note that will generate a LOT of output

make-missing
	Create stand-alone missing-certs.html that lists what certs
	are missing, in a format similar to make-page.
